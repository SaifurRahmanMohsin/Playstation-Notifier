# Playstation 5 Notifier

Made this fun project over the weekend because I was tired of refreshing the Amazon page hoping for the Playstation 5 to launch so I can get it.

This is written on Kotlin using [Jetbrains' Compose for Desktop](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb) and basically checks every minute for the status and plays music when the product becomes available.
